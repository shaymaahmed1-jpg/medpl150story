     <h1 style="color:brown; align:center;">You stop in your tracks and face the cat head on. </h1>

<br>

     <h1 style="color:brown; align:center;"> You look into its eyes with curiousity and care, trying to pierce through the kitty's anger and reach its heart. </h1>

    <br>
    
<h2 style="color: #F53F07; align:center;">The cat walks towards you with its head lowered. You reach out, and the gentle creature rests its head in your hand. As it turns out, all it wanted was some love. You're safe, and you now have a new giant pet cat. But, most importantly, you have a friend.</h2>
